This is the logbook for the project book for ease of access to the commits done into this repo and therefore improve the workflow.
Due to some problems in personal life(s) , we are slightly behind with the schedule, but we'll (hopefully) pull this through well within the deadline. 
It'll maybe take us 2-3 days more to fully understand the libraries before laying our hands on the keyboard and smash those keys and hopefully (or with the power of geek-magic I guess?) successfully produce a WORKING SOURCE CODE (we can figure the debugging part later :v).
