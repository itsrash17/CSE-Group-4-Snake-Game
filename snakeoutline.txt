The snake game has a window which has a border , a moving object , a static object.
The moving object is a snake, which moves around inside the border. The static object or the marker is a fruit which is eaten by the snake(or collided into)
As the snake eats the fruit , its body length increases gradually.
The snake starts from the center of the border, and the fruits are generated randomly within the border.

The objective of the game is to move around into the marker (or in this case a static object which is a fruit) that is randomly generated without colliding with the border and its own body. 
Eating each fruit gives the player one points.
The win is determined by the points earnt by eating the fruit.
The game will take user inputs through W,A,S,D keys on the keyboard





After looking at the game mechanics, we can see , there are several parts which need to be done using custom-library functions , in order to optimize the size of the final source code of the game.
We will use functions to do these following tasks-
1. Create a window
2. Create and specify the boundary
3. Define the moving object- snake and its features.
4. Define the static object- fruit and code it to be spawned randomly within the boundaries. 
5. Make an argument that specifies conditions of starting and ending the game.
6. Make a library function that stores the points earned and show the score at the end of the game.
7. Integrate a library that takes key inputs from the player.
